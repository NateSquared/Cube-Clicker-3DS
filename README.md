# Cube-Clicker-3DS
Port of a Scratch game I made when I was 14 to learn the LÖVEPotion framework

Due to how LÖVEPotion works, you need to run the game on a modded Nintendo 3DS in the Homebrew Menu. Although if you were to download the source files and run them in LÖVE2D 11.5 or later, you effectively have a PC version, although it only works with a controller.
