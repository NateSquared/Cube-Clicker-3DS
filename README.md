# Cube-Clicker-3DS
Port of a [Scratch game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/251999490) I made when I was 14

I made this game to learn the LÖVEPotion framework.

## Controls

Cube Click - A, B, X, Y, the DPAD, and the Shoulder Buttons (NOT THE TRIGGERS)

Menu Swap - Select

Save & Exit - Start

## Running

Due to how LÖVEPotion works, you need to run the game on a modded Nintendo 3DS in the Homebrew Menu. Although if you were to download the source files and run them in LÖVE2D 11.5 or later, you effectively have a PC version, although it only works with a controller.
